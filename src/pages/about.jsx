Choosing which menu items to feature should be enjoyable for any food lover, but make your decisions carefully. Your menu will dictate the type of equipment you'll need, the skills you should look for in your staff, and the type of crowd you hope to attract. For instance, if you envision a dessert menu full of delicate French pastries, you'll need a pastry chef and the supplies to match. If pizza is your thing, you'll need dough mixers, proofers, and experienced chefs who know how to handle pizza dough.

If you get a great deal on leasing a space in a college town, your restaurant menu should be tailored to college-age customers.
